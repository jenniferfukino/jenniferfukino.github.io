In How To Ask Questions The Smart Way, Eric Raymond unapologetically explains why some questions are met with such hostility. Simply, the 
question was asked in a "not so smart way."

## Stop beating around the bush

A question asked in a "smart way" will demonstrate your thought process and effort in trying to find the solution, while displaying your newly acquired 
knowledge from your failed attempts. The question will be clear and concise which communicates your acknowledgement and appreciation 
of someone else's time. An example, found on Stack Overflow, that illustrates a smart question had a clear and concise subject line that 
read: "redis: max number of clients reached." Next, in the post the questioner goes on to explain what the issue was, what he/she tried to do to 
solve the problem, along with some thoughts on what he/she thought might be the problem, and attached code. Within nine minutes the question
was answered and solved. The ability of the questioner to ask the question in a "smart way" proved pleasant and fruitful in the end.

## You asked WHAT?!

I don't think there are dumb questions but there is a "not so smart way" of asking a question. An example of this type of question, found in
Stack Overflow, has a questioner asking "Is there a way to duplicate a list element without using loop in python?" This question translates 
into "I need the answer for my homework assignment." In the post, the questioner goes on explaining the assignment and posting what little code 
they did. A respondent was quick to call out this being a homework assignment and the lack of effort on the questioner's part to find a solution. 
By asking a question in a "not so smart" way you may unintentionally brand yourself lazy, thoughtless, uneducated and ultimately unworthy of
help.

## No dumb questions

“There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry 
to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question.”
                                                              ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark

I think the above quote by Carl Sagan says it best. There really are no dumb questions, but there are many questions that are asked in a "not so
smart" way. Computer Science is a difficult field which tackles difficult problems daily and asking questions are helpful for clarification and to
gain a better understanding of the topic. However, knowledge flows both ways and by asking in a "smart way" you might offer a challenging thought-
provoking question that stimulates your respondent. Asking a question the "smart way" helps develop effective communication skills, foster a 
collaborating environment while also cultivating an independent self-sufficient achiever.
