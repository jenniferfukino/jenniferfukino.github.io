The phrase, "there are plenty of fish in the sea" was first declared in the United States by J.C. Lincoln. Now you might be wondering what significance does this specific phrase that is often said in consolation after a breakup have with computer science. Well, it's not so much about the breakup but more about the number of options that one has for future partners that is relevant. 

Computer science is "the plenty of fish in the sea" or "the future partners" that you somehow have to navigate to find your perfect match. The field of computer science and engineering is an intricate and diverse network built with intercommunicating paths that encompass an extensive spectrum of interest areas. A simple google search "What is computer science?" returns 19,880,000,000 results which makes it increasingly difficult to filter out key information forcing you to do another search that might return even more results or worse, results that are irrelevant. 

# Dating process made easy with RadGrad

RadGrad is refreshing and strangely, has similarities to a dating app. Now I'm not saying that I have any experience with dating apps and by no means am I judging anyone who uses one. But, in a simplistic form the information you provide on the dating app helps to determine matches or compatibility with another member. Obviously, the more variety in information you provide like: interests, lifestyle, affiliations will produce a more suitable match. Thus, enhancing your overall experience.

By adding my interests into RadGrad, twenty interesting and some unfamiliar career recommendations appeared. Just like in a dating app, you quickly look at a photo and instinctively decide to swipe right to accept or left to reject. From the brief descriptions provided I was able to quickly reduce my "fishes" to just three: Mobile App Developer, Software Developer and UX Designer. Simultaneously, in accepting my selection RadGrad also offered me new relevant interests based on my career aspirations that I might have overlooked. Conversely though, one thing to be mindful of is that some career choices, like Software Developer, has a ton of interests and if accepted can generate irrelevant recommendations.

# Could this be a match?

What is a UX Designer? Before RadGrad, I was unaware of a computer science career where a designer is responsible for creating an enjoyable experience of the product or service experienced by the user through product definition, research, analysis, design and testing. But, the description of a UX Designer  is so familiar to me. Determining trends and consumer needs through research, collaborating with design teams to develop ideas for new products, product development, design and testing are all duties of a Fashion Designer. Although RadGrad does not have fashion as an interest, my interest in computer graphics generated UX Designer as a compatible career choice. The Career Goals details page not only offered a brief description and interesting video but it enhanced the experience by recommending career specific courses, an alternative degree plan, and a community of students with similar interests.

RadGrad offers a comprehensive college experience by creating a visible interdependent connection between your interests, career goals, courses and opportunities. The courses I have taken are based off of the University's degree requirement, with no promise of landing a job. RadGrad offers no promises, but its insights provide me with a better chance to make purposeful selections in future courses and opportunities to further my knowledge with a specific career goal in mind.
