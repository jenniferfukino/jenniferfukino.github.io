With no prior experience or knowledge of JavaScript, I did what any person would do in this day and age. I Googled it! And what I
learned is that JavaScript initially began as a scripting language to validate client side input in the time of dial-up connection. 
JavaScript has evolved into a programming language that is used to build modern web applications, enable dynamic interactivity and 
special effects on web pages, and much more. 

## Flexibilty

For many, JavaScript seems to be a sensitive topic. There are those who love it, those who hate it, and those who are indifferent.
Learning the history of JavaScript gave me a deeper appreciation for how far this programming language has come. Compared to stricter
languages like Java, JavaScript's syntax flexibility in allowing variables to be broadly declared using let or const allows for
faster coding. Having only a week experience with JavaScript, I am already excited about learning this new language. But with any new language, it is a process and will take some time in getting used to this new flexiblity and language specific coding styles. 

## What the WOD!

The Athletic Software Engineering pedagogy is very rigorous, its beast mode training, but if you want to perform at your peak level
then you must get uncomfortable. The ever looming "DNF" haunts my sleep at the moment because it takes me time to formulate ideas and
with the click of the timer my mind tends to go blank. But I believe in the process. I continue to repeat the practice WOD's until I 
am able to solve the problem in the given time and have a designated 2-hour study slot every day. The Athletic Software Engineering 
Pedagogy allows me a way to measure my comprehension of the information and my ability to access and successfully apply what I 
learned. I am able to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses and quickly assess what I really need to focus on.
