|Say Yes To The Dress| | | | | | | | | |
|People's opinion about JavaScript is much like choosing a wedding gown. You have those who love it| those who hate it| and those who are indifferent just because they don't want to hurt your feelings.  I am enjoying the freedom JavaScript provides compared to other languages. I feel maybe if we learned it earlier it could allow students to gain more confidence in coding and then refine their skills with stricter languages. But| is it because of this rebelliousness that we don't learn it earlier? Or is it because it is deemed an easy language? What is easy to some is not always easy for all? But I'll leave it to the powers that be to make that decision. Learning a new language does take me time to understand and  gain the confidence to properly use the language. JavaScript is no exception| I continue to repeat modules in FreeCodeCamp to get more practice speaking JavaScript| but I will say "Yes" to the dress. | | | | |

|Training For This Moment| | | | | | | | | |
|The Na Wahine O Ke Kai| normally occuring on the fourth Sunday of September| is a 41-mile women?s canoe race with participants ranging in age from 16 - 60+. On the day of the race over 60 canoes can be seen in Hale O Lono Harbor| on the island of Moloka?i| pointing the nose of their canoes toward Waikiki Beach| on the island of O?ahu.   These individuals have spent over 2000 hours of rigorous training preparing their minds and bodies for this race| so they can perform at their optimal level. This 41-mile race tests your physical strength| endurance| determination and mental toughness. Depending on conditions| some teams will not even make it out of the harbor. |
|Software engineering| for me| is very similar to participating in the Na Wahine O Ke Kai. Software engineering is very intimidating and can take months| maybe even years to be good at. But with the right training it is possible to be successful no matter your age or physical ability at the specific moment you make the decision to go for it. | | | | | | |
|The athletic software engineering model is very rigorous| it?s beast mode training| but if you want to perform at your peak then you have to get uncomfortable.  And boy am I uncomfortable. It makes me question| Did my other classes prepare me for this moment?| Am I starting at a disadvantage already?| What should I have been doing to prepare?.  I enjoy the repetition in the athletic software engineering model.  The idea of having to repeat the practice WOD over and over again until you make that given time allows me a way to measure my comprehension of the information and my ability to access and successful apply what I learned. It allows me to reflect on where my abilities currently are and assess what I need more practice with. In other classes once I solved the problem I moved on and it definitely took me longer than 8-min but| did I get anything from it?| | | |
