# A fashion designer can be a software engineer

At Hussein Chalayan's Spring 2007 show, a model walks out onto the runaway with a Victorian-inspired gown and pauses in the middle of the
stage hands by her side. Slowly her garment begins to open as if someone were undressing her. As she stands there, the garment continues 
its transformation into another silhouette. As the next five looks individually come out onto the runway, the audience are captivated
by the metmorphose of each look. Hussein Chalayan was able to use microchips to create his innovative designs. If microchips can be added
to garments, what else can be done? Software engineering provides a highway of different paths and right now I'm still undecided. I am 
interested in designing a 3D body scanning app to help customers find their perfect fit, an A.I. program that allows anyone to design and 
manufacture their own clothes, and technology infused textiles. Are these even possible? Like clothing sketches in my drawing book, I just 
need to understand how to draft the pattern so I can cut and sew.  

# In five, four, three...

Music starts, lights go on , and my brain goes blank. Reflecting on my classes, computer and others, I was studying to make an 'A'. 
The athletic software engineering pedagogy has really opened my eyes to my weaknesses. When underpressure I have not mastered Java, C++,
and JavaScript which makes it very hard to become a software engineer. I need to master these languages and change how I approach
learning in all of my classes. Aside from language mastery, the biggest thing I hope to gain is confidence in my programming skills. With 
confidence and of course improved programming skills, I will be more likely to apply for internships, jobs, and other programming
opportunities.
