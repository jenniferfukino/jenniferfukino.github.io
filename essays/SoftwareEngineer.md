# A fashion designer can be a software engineer

At Hussein Chalayan's Spring 2007 show, a model walks out onto the runaway with a Victorian-inspired gown and pauses in the middle of the
stage hands by her side. Slowly her garment begins to open as if someone were undressing her. As she stands there, the garment continues 
its transformation into another silhouette. As the next five looks individually come out onto the runway, the audience are captivated
by the metmorphose of each look. Hussein Chalayan was able to use microchips to create his innovative designs. If microchips can be added
to garments, what else can be done? 

Fashion isn't easy but I get it and honestly I don't know just yet how I can incorporate fashion into software engineering. I am interested in 
designing a 3D body scanning app to help customers find their perfect fit, an A.I. program that allows anyone to design and manufacture their
own clothes, and technology infused textiles. Are these even possible? There are so much possibilities in software engineering that I remain 
undecided in the path I will take. 

At the moment, my dream of creating a technology infused textile is snapped back into perspective. The athletic software engineering pedagogy
really opened my eyes to my strengths and a lot of my opportunities. In order to be a successful software engineer, the skills I hope to 
develop in the future are mastering the programming languages, having the ability to problem solve efficiently and to gain more confidence in 
my programming skills. As for my experiences in the future, I am more focused on the present and the path ahead of me because it is one filled
with numerous learning hurdles. With more confidence and of course improved programmming skills, I will be more likely to apply for jobs and 
other programming opportunities. Like clothing sketches in my drawing book, I just need to understand how to draft the pattern so I can cut and 
sew.
